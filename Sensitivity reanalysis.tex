\section{Sensitivity reanalysis}
The previous section indicated that two of four data analytic choices are disputable and warrants sensitivity reanalysis. I define a sensitivity reanalysis as reanalysis where only minor adjustments are made and inspected whether original results hold. This is opposite to a strong reanalysis, where substantial changes are made to the data analytic strategy.

In this sensitivity reanalysis evidence for p-hacking stays equally strong or becomes even stronger across the board, mainly due to the change from selecting $p<.05$ to $p\leq.05$. For example, the evidence for p-hacking in the Results section across all fields was strong originally ($P=.546$, lower $95\%CI$ $[.535],p<.001$) and even stronger afterwards ($P=.731$, lower $95\%CI$ $[.723],p<.001$).

In the next section I argue that this data analytic strategy is suboptimal, however, and that a different strategy removes all evidence for p-hacking.
