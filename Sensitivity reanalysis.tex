The previous section indicated that two of four data analytic choices are disputable and warrants sensitivity reanalysis. I define a sensitivity reanalysis as reanalysis where only minor adjustments are made and inspected whether original results hold. This is opposite to a strong reanalysis, where substantial changes are made to the data analytic strategy.
