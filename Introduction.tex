Megan Head and colleagues provide a large collection of p-values that, from their perspective, indicates widespread statistical significance seeking throughout the sciences. 

I applaud their transparency in sharing both the data and analysis scripts, allowing for alternative data analytic perspectives to this substantial claim. In this paper I review their analytic choices and make some comments, following which I adjust for these comments and reevaluate the results.

In line with their original openness, I version controlled all my research efforts. Version control provides a timestamped history of the changes made to files, such as the analysis code or the writing \citep{Ram2015}. This sort of track changes for files is valuable for reproducing the research process and could be investigated when data dredging is suspected.
