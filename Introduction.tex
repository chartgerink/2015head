Megan Head and colleagues provide a large collection of p-values that indicates widespread statistical significance seeking throughout the sciences from their data analytic perspective. Throughout their paper, they succinctly distinguish the evidential value of an effect based on p-values reported in a paper and the evidence for p-hacking. Such p-curve analysis, or p-uniform analysis, are highly valuable as has been previously indicated. 

I applaud their transparency in sharing both the data and analysis scripts, allowing for alternative data analytic perspectives. In this paper I review their analytic choices and make some comments, following which I adjust for these comments and reevaluate the results.
