\section{Conclusion}
These reanalyses indicate that the evidence for p-hacking is either underestimated (sensitivity reanalysis) or artefactual  (strong reanalysis). The problem of second-decimal reporting bias is, in my opinion, something that cannot be neglected and therefore I conclude that there is no evidence for widespread p-hacking throughout the sciences. This is in line with a previous reanalysis that indicated that the paper that initiated this line of research into p-hacking \cite{Masicampo2012} did not provide sufficient evidence for p-hacking after all \cite{Lakens2014}. However, we should be cautious about concluding that the lack of evidence for p-hacking is evidence for its absence.
