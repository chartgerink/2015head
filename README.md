# Reanalyzing Head et al. 2015

This repository is linked to the Authorea document contained [here](https://www.authorea.com/users/2013/articles/29087/_show_article). The repo immediately includes all analyses included in the paper. However, note that Github does not allow for files >100mb and therefore the original data package first needs to be unzipped! Only then will you be able to run the analyses immediately.
