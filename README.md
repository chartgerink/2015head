# Reanalyzing Head et al. 2015

This repository is linked to the Authorea document contained [here](https://www.authorea.com/users/2013/articles/31568/_show_article). The repo immediately includes all analyses included in the paper. However, note that Github does not allow for files >100mb and therefore the original data package first needs to be unzipped! Only then will you be able to run the analyses immediately. 

The FILES_FOR_DRYAD.zip is the *original* data from the Head et al. paper, retrieved from [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.79d43/1).

##NOTE this repo is deprecated and only a backup for authorea. The up-to-date repo is [2016head](https://github.com/chartgerink/2016head)
