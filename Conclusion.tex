\section*{Conclusion}
These reanalyses indicate that the evidence for p-hacking is either underestimated (sensitivity reanalysis) or artefactual  (full reanalysis). The problem of second-decimal reporting bias is, in my opinion, something that cannot be neglected and therefore I conclude that the data provided by Head and colleagues yields no substantial evidence for widespread p-hacking throughout the sciences. This is in line with a previous reanalysis that indicated that the paper that initiated the line of research into p-hacking \cite{Masicampo2012} did not provide sufficient evidence for p-hacking after \cite{Lakens2014}. In sum, this reanalysis yields no evidence for widespread p-hacking.
