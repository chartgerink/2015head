In order to take into account the two-decimal reporting tendency, I propose a minor, but crucial, adjustment to the data analytic strategy. The application of the Caliper test, where frequencies of two bins are compared, is maintained, but adjusted. Instead of selecting the final two bins, the bins adjacent to round second decimals are chosen. Additionally, the binwidth is adjusted from .005 to .00125 for more precision and comparability with previous research \cite{Masicampo2012, Leggett2013}.
