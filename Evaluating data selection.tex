In their original analyses, Head and colleagues use seven selection steps. First, they select only papers including NHST p-values. Second, only papers with a DOI are retained. Third, only papers with p-values in the results section are retained. Fourth, only papers with non-zero authors are retained. Fifth, supplemental materials are removed. Sixth, only p-values smaller than .05 are retained (i.e., $<.05$). Finally, only exactly reported p-values are retained (i.e., $p=...$).
